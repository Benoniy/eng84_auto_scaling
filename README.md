* Vertical Scaling   - The process of increasing the capability of a single machine in order to fulfill greater 
  demand.  
  

* Horizontal Scaling - The process of increasing the amount of machines to distribute demand across them.  


### Load Balancers  
Earlier I said that demand could be distributed among several machines, this is usually achieved by using a load 
balancer.
